Let's play with angular and build c2c statistics viewers
## TODO

* More charts
* Translations
* Choose best language base on logged in user
* AOT in prod?
* handle errors when autocomplete or data retrieval fails
* better layout (use card only for graph sections)
* cache using webstorage
* maybe web workers?
* Unit tests

## angular-cli

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
